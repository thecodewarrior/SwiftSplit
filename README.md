# Splits JSON

Splits are configured using a JSON file and use "events" generated by MacSplit.Celeste. They consist of a reset event 
and a list of route events. Unlike the route, which listens for events in a specific order, the reset event can trigger 
at any point during the route. Each entry in the 

```json
{
    "useFileTime": false,
    "reset": "reset chapter",
    "route": [
        "start chapter 2",
        "d8 > d3",
        "3x > 3",
        "8 > 9",
        "10 > 2",
        "12 > 13",
        "complete chapter 2"
    ]
}
```

The currently defined events are (`<...>` indicates a fill-in parameter):
- `start chapter <n>` - Triggered when the specified chapter number is started
- `reset chapter` - Triggered when the current chapter is reset (either by restarting the chapter or exiting to the map)
- `complete chapter <n>` - Triggered when the specified chapter number is completed
- `<from screen> > <to screen>` - Triggered when transitioning between two screens (you can find the screen IDS by
  looking at the `Level: Name:` when connected to Celeste, or by enabling debug and hovering over the screen in the map 
  editor.

Note that the *exact* text is important. Spaces and capitalization have to match. Also, inserting an exclamation point 
(`!`) at the beginning of an event will cause that event to not trigger a split. This can be useful when your route
passes between two screens multiple times but you only want one split.
